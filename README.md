# Belwerks - 2025

Simple rebuild of the Belwerks website, with a focus on Stephen's intro, career focus, and some sampled work.

## Run Locally

Open the root and run `npm install && npm start` from your terminal. The static site will be available at `localhost:3000`.

## Deploy Updates

Any push to the remote `main` branch will automatically be deployed. Only contents of the `/docs` folder will be served to the GitHub Pages instance.
