        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer with over a decade of experience
          crafting accessible, performant, and user-focused web applications.
          Since starting my career in 2012, I’ve specialized in modern front-end
          development with a strong foundation in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript,
          and have been working extensively with React and TypeScript since
          2015.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work is deeply rooted in WCAG-compliant accessibility, clean
          component architecture, and scalable design systems. I’m passionate
          about building interfaces that are not only beautiful and responsive
          but also inclusive and usable by all. With a product-minded approach,
          I enjoy collaborating closely with designers and backend engineers to
          deliver thoughtful, maintainable solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently leaning into UI architecture and broader front-end strategy,
          I also take pride in mentoring teammates, contributing to
          cross-functional teams, and fostering a strong engineering culture.
          Whether shipping polished features or refactoring for long-term
          maintainability, I bring a mix of design sensibility, technical rigor,
          and user empathy to every project.
